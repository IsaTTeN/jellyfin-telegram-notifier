#### Environment Variables Explanation:

- **`EPISODE_PREMIERED_WITHIN_X_DAYS`**:
  Determines how recent an episode's premiere date must be for a notification to be sent. For example, setting it to `7` means only episodes that premiered within the last 7 days will trigger a notification.

- **`SEASON_ADDED_WITHIN_X_DAYS`**:
  Dictates the threshold for sending notifications based on when a season was added to Jellyfin. If set to `3`, then if a season was added within the last 3 days, episode notifications will not be sent to avoid potential spam from adding an entire season at once.
